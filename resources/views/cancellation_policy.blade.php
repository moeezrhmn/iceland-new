is an online booking platform and travel consultant focused on
Iceland. All bookings made through Icelandonleine.com are processed by third-party
companies offering activity tours.</p>
<p>It's crucial to note that refund and cancellation policies of third-party companies can
differ. We strongly advise you to review the speciﬁc company's guidelines for their terms
and conditions, as this will ensure you make informed decisions.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide you with professional services at competitive prices.
Icelandonleine.com offers a wide range of products from over 20 local tour operators,
suppliers, and service providers. This diversity makes Icelandonleine.com your go-to
resource for ﬁnding the perfect excursion tours in Iceland.</p>


<h3>Cancellations Due to Weather Conditions</h3>
<p>If your tour provider cancels your tour due to weather conditions or other environmental
factors, you will receive a full refund. If a volcanic eruption on Icelandic soil prevents
you from travelling to Iceland, you will also receive a full refund for all products booked
through Icelandonline.com.</p>

<p>It's important to note that our refund policy does not apply if you choose not to visit due
to an eruption. This is because volcanic activity in Iceland is relatively common and
usually occurs far from populated or travel-relevant areas. We want to ensure you
clearly understand when the refund policy does not apply.</p>

<p>General Terms Icelandonleine.com is not liable for any losses, damages, accidents,
injuries, death, or illness that may occur during your trip. This also includes any changes
to your trip schedule due to weather, strikes, or other unforeseen circumstances.
Service providers reserve the right to modify routes, schedules, and itineraries as
necessary due to weather, road conditions or other unforeseen situations.</p>

<p>To ensure you are fully protected, we strongly advise all travellers to purchase
comprehensive travel insurance. This will help minimize potential losses from
unexpected travel events. Icelandonleine.com does not provide travel insurance, so
please contact your preferred private travel insurance company.</p>
<p>By booking with Icelandonleine.com, you agree to these terms and conditions. We
recommend thoroughly reviewing all sections and reaching out to us with any questions
before completing your booking. If you have a complaint about any of our partners,
please contact us at Iceland@icelandonline.com, and we will assist you in protecting
